# Motivation
The notion of machine learning has been around for a while, yet my exposure to this fascinating field has only been limited to some basic coursework and a number of sporadic video clips. Last week, I finally made up my mind to utilize some of my mutilated free time to get my foot wet, and try to gain an understanding of what's going on. 

## Time Stamps

<i>11/07/2025 - To be frank, it is questionalble how far I can advance in this path, but that's what makes a journey interesting, isn't it.</i><br>
<i>12/05/2025 - That's been a while, but it's interesting to learn how stochastic gradient descent works and how backpropogation is implemented. Tweaking cost functions and regularization does seem to avoid neural saturation and certainly speed up the training speed.</i><br>
<i>12/06/2025 - To further gain some motivation, I decided to do some relatively simpler tasks by systematically learning some pandas basics</i><br>
